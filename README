This is the Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences. The original
version of the kit (aimed at software developers) is by Phil Hagelberg
and is located at
http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/. This version
descends directly from the "Literate Programming" fork created by Eric
Schulte. That version is located at
http://github.com/eschulte/emacs-starter-kit. They did the
overwhelming majority of the work behind what you see here.

The Starter Kit provides a saner set of defaults than you get normally
with Emacs. It's intended for beginners, but provides a good elisp
initialization structure for all levels of users. The target audience
for this version is graduate students and researchers working in the
social sciences, writing papers using LaTeX and doing data analysis
with R, Stata, or SAS.

The main advantage of this Emacs Starter Kit are
- better default settings
- inclusion of many useful libraries
- "literate" customization embedded in Org-mode files
- an organizational directory structure
- git provides for version control, backup, and sharing
